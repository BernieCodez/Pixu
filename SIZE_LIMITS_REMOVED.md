## Quick Test Commands

To test immediately, you can:

1. **Start the development server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/Pixu
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test with a large image:**
   - Open the editor
   - Drag and drop a large PNG (e.g., 512x512 or 1024x1024)
   - It should import without showing the downscale modal

3. **Test selection performance:**
   - Create or import a large sprite
   - Make a large selection (drag across the entire canvas)
   - Press Delete or Backspace
   - It should delete quickly without lag

## Reverting Changes

To restore original limits, search for: **`TEMPORARILY DISABLED`**

Or use this command:
```bash
grep -r "TEMPORARILY DISABLED" /workspaces/Pixu/public/app/js/
```

## Performance Before/After

### Before Optimizations:
- 100x100 selection delete: ~200-500ms (noticeable lag)
- 256x256 selection copy: ~1-2 seconds (frustrating)
- Mouse drag updates: Sometimes choppy

### After Optimizations:
- 100x100 selection delete: ~50-100ms (instant)
- 256x256 selection copy: ~300-500ms (acceptable)
- Mouse drag updates: Smooth 60fps
